## Deep-learning-challenge
Using Tensor flow, this model designs a neural network to create a binary classification model that predicts if an Alphabet Soup-funded organisation will be successful .  

  
## 1. Model 1

- Results were saved and exported as "AlphabetSoupCharity.h5"  

## 2. Optimised Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow,we optimise the model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
- Scored Accuracy Result ` __%`

Model notes:

## 3. Report
The report evaluates the performance of the optimised model.
